Need to create a DNS entry for the Ingress  LB (this is even part of the cert-manager documentation).
Kops does that for you, but for other backends you must have it.

It is possible to install the standard NGInx Ingress Controller instead of the ALB Ingress Controller.
Maybe there are some advantages, but this can simplify the deployment.

NGinx Ingress:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/service-l7.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/patch-configmap-l7.yaml
